# About

<p class="p-2">
    This app is a very simple demonstration of creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) 
    the basic information of a Farmer at Bedrock Farmers Coop.  
    The app uses object-oriented ColdFusion to accomplish this along utilizing the following technologies:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Bootstrap 5.2</li>
    <li>Javascript (Vanilla, JQuery, Node)</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>ColdFusion 2018</li>
    <li>MS SQL Server, SQL Server Studio</li>
    <li>MS Visual Studio Code</li>
    <li>REST API concepts using ColdFusion (Reports)
    <li>Protection against SQL injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc. using appropriate ColdFusion
        tags and functions (ie, cfqueryparam, canonicalize, regular expressions, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p class="p-2">The idea of the demo and the use of node came from https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter.  Much thanks!  The file called "bfc_tables.sql" are the MS SQL Server tables used to run this demo app.
